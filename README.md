# videt -- Vizualising Datasets of Ecological Trend

a collaborative project of [Hacking Ecology](https://hackingecology.eu/), a collective for open data, open source and
citizen science that helps us avert the sixth mass extinction.

videt visualizes open datasets of processes that might have an influence on ecosystem functioning. At its core, it uses
[bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) and allows users to interactively choose datasets to show.

### Requirements
```` bokeh ```` and ````pandas```` are required to run this application. To install requirements using pip execute ````pip install -r requirements.txt````.

### Usage

As there is no online version of videt yet, users need to clone the repo, `cd` into the videt folder and then run

```
bokeh serve ./ --show
```

### Structure

As required by Bokeh, `main.py` is the index file that points to the other features of videt. `scripts/plotting_tab.py`
contains the code for the GUI and all the plotting commands, `scripts/info_tab.py` creates the second tab of videt.
`scripts/datasets.py` contains the code that loads the datasets. If you want to add new datasets they need to inherit
from `timeseries_dataset` and implement all the fields and functions of it; please see to the other datasets already
implemented for reference. Currently, `config/` contains a single config file that indicates the datasets implemented
and the arguments relevant for them.


## To-Do's

Improve everything you want. Work on the todos in the code. Implement new datasets. Thank you very much in advance.
